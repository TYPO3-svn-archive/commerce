Related Products: Currently, only 3 products will be shown, even though it is possible to assign a product to as many other
products as desired. Additionally, sorting is only done by entry date of the products.

The category tree in product listing plugin does not work if TYPO3 is installed in a subdirectory and not in webroot. You can
select categories but you cannot not expand and fold the tree here. As a workaround you can expand the tree in the
Commerce>Categories module before opening the plugin. See http://forge.typo3.org/issues/9120
